Like soap, which has a good smell and foams easily, is satisfying to wash your hands, which means good hygiene.\\n\\nWhat is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. The consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. With good habits, it\\'s the opposite. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long run, and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don\\'t. Incentives can start a habit.

It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better. But the upside is once developed, it can be done on autopilot.

The consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. With good habits it\\'s the opposite. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don\\'t. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. While rewards can get you to start a new behavior, it\\'s the way you view yourself that helps you maintain that behavior over time.  Chapter 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every day  Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles provide clear evidence of your progress. This way each day you know how much progress you are making. So keep a habit tracker to help you stay consistent. \"Don\\'t break the chain\" is a powerful mantra. Don\\'t break the chain of coding and you will become a successful AI engineer. Don\\'t break the chain of going to gym and eating good and you will have a nice body. Don\\'t break the chain of missing your prayers and you will become a better Muslim.',\n",
       " \"Here is the cleaned and formatted text:  Atomic Habits Notes  Habit tracking provides visual proof of your hard work - a subtle reminder of how far you've come. The empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get started because you don't want to lose your progress by breaking the streak. You are not perfect, so always try to avoid the second lapse.  Chapter 17 - How an accountability partner can change everything  4th Law: Make it immediately unsatisfying. Just like we would want to experience something which has a satisfying ending, we don't want to experience something which has unsatisfying ending. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. This can be a good strategy for Fajr. A way to add an immediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator. What habit contract can I make for missing Fajr? Perhaps setting aside $5 for a masjid donation, and if that doesn't work out, on the day I miss it, there's no gym!  \",\n",
       " 'Cleaned and Formatted Text:  Atomic Habits Notes  Your personality is a set of the \"Big 5\" characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation:  - Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. - Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. - Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). - Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. - Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.  In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. After that, shift your focus to the best solution you\\'ve found but keep experimenting occasionally. Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the \"accident\" of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you.  Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.  Chapter 19 - The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work  The way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of \"just manageable difficulty.\" Because even though a human brain loves a challenge, it has to be in its optimal zone of difficulty. This is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.  The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too easy, not too hard, just right.',\n",
       " 'Cleaned and formatted text:  Atomic Habits Notes  It\\'s not too hard, not too easy, just right. It has to be on the edge of getting out of your optimal reach. The key to mastering a habit is progressive overload, just like in the gym. But when you\\'re starting out, keep it easy so you don\\'t lose motivation, and then gradually increase it. These little improvements and new challenges keep you engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a flow state.   A flow state is the experience of being \"in the zone\" and fully immersed in an activity. Everyone loses motivation, but the main difference between a successful person and someone who gives up is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. The biggest threat is not failure, it\\'s boredom.   No habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom. Remember, you have to fall in love with boredom. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.  Chapter 20 - The Downside of Creating Good Habits  The benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it \"good enough\" on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.   But the upside is once developed, it can be done on autopilot. You can\\'t repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional.   In summary, Habits lead to Deliberate Practice, which in turn leads to Mastery.',\n",
       " \"Cleaned and formatted text:  Atomic Habits Notes  You need to stay conscious of your performance over time, so you can refine and improve. The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review. Once again, it is about improving by 1% each time, Career Best Effort (CBE).  Sustaining effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time. Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about fine-tuning them.  In the review part, ask yourself questions, what did you do correct, what did you do wrong? Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.   Don't just sit down and keep doing your habits, take out time and review them over a period, set periods. Be open to changes, don't just let one habit define you and think you are always right.   Don't tie your identity to one thing: Meaning, you are not just a good AI Engineer, you are an expert at problem-solving and you can take on any challenge. What happens once you become an AI Engineer, is that it?  Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you. A lack of self-awareness is poison.
